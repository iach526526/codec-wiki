## Clone & Push Instructions
**Make sure to clone from & edit the** `main` **branch only, & push your final changes to the** `deployment` **branch according to the instructions below. Also be sure to use node 18 LTS, as later versions tend to be troublesome.**

2. Test your changes locally before making a commit:

3. Push changes to `main` branch:
