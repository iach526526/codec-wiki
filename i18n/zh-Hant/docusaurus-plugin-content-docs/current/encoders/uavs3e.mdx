# uavs3e

`[uavs3e](https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e/)` is an open-source encoder for the [AVS3](/docs/video/AVS3) codec. It was developed by Chinese research institutions, including Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Peng Cheng Laboratory, and Guangdong Bohua UHD Innovation Corporation.

The encoder is infrequently updated, which may lead to bugs & compilation issues. It supports AMD64 with AVX2, ARM with NEON, and LoongArch CPUs.

## Installation

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="unixlike" label="Linux & macOS">
        The developers do not provide pre-built binaries of their encoder, so you'll need to compile it yourself.

        Compilation requires GNU Make and CMake. As of August 2024, `uavs3e` doesn't compile with GCC 14. Using Clang 18 instead of GCC resolves this issue.

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e.git
        cd uavs3e
        mkdir build/linux && cd build/linux
        cmake ../.. -DCOMPILE_10BIT=0 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
        make -j 8
        ```

        If you encounter undefined calls to `close` or `lseek64` functions, add the following two lines at the top of the `test/utest.c` file:

        ```c
        #define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
        #include <unistd.h>
        ```

        Binaries will be available in the `build/linux` folder. On Linux, you can run `make install` to install the encoder (may require elevated permissions).

        ### 10-bit Support

        To enable 10-bit support, set `-DCOMPILE_10BIT=1` in the CMake command. However, the encoder compiled with this flag has been reported to [cause segmentation faults on some systems](https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e/issues/53).

    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
        1. Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed before starting the build process:
        - [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/): Select "Desktop development with C++".
        - [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

        2. Open Developer PowerShell for VS 2022.

        3. Run the following commands:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e.git
        cd uavs3e
        .\version.bat
        cd build\x86_windows
        devenv uavs3e.sln /Upgrade
        msbuild uavs3e.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:WindowsTargetPlatformVersion=10.0
        ```

        Binaries will be available in the `bin` folder.

        ### 10-bit Support

        To enable 10-bit support, change the line `#define COMPILE_10BIT 0` to `#define COMPILE_10BIT 1` in the `inc/com_api.h` file.

## Usage

The encoder cannot parse `.y4m` files, so they need to be converted to the raw video (`.yuv`) format.

```bash title="Simple 8-bit FHD 23.976 fps input with QP 20 and raw avs3 bitstream output"
uavs3enc -i input.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -d 8 --fps_num 24000 --fps_den 1001 -q 20 -o output.avs3
```

```bash title="Speed 2, CRF 20, intra period 120, multithreaded"
uavs3enc -i input.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -d 8 --fps_num 24000 --fps_den 1001 -p 120 --wpp_threads 8 --frm_threads 8 --speed_level 2 --rc_type 1 -q 20 -o output.avs3
```

Currently, uavs3e [does not support piping](https://github.com/uavs3/uavs3e/issues/2).

## Notes

1. Usable speed presets range from 0 to 4, where 0 is the slowest and 4 is the fastest.
2. The encoder can be quite competitive, even compared to the newest [AV1](../video/AV1.mdx) and [VVC](../video/VVC.mdx) encoders in terms of visual fidelity.
3. `uavs3d` can be used to decode the output bitstream. For real-time playback, you need to have [FFmpeg](/docs/utilities/ffmpeg) compiled with `--enable-libuavs3d`.
