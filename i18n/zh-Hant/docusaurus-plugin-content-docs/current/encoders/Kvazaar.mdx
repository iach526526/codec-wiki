# Kvazaar

[Kvazaar](https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar) is an open-source [H.265 / HEVC](/docs/video/HEVC) software encoder Written in C, developed by [Ultra Video Group](https://ultravideo.fi/) and licensed under BSD 3-clause.

[uvg266](/docs/encoders/uvg266) (Developed by the same group) uses Kvazaar as a base for encoding to the [VVC](/docs/video/VVC) codec.

[x265](/docs/encoders/x265) is generally regarded as having better performance while producing better quality video streams.

## FFmpeg

Kvazaar is available in [FFmpeg](../utilities/ffmpeg.mdx) via ``libkvazaar``, to check if you have it, run ``ffmpeg -h encoder=libkvazaar``. You can input non-FFmpeg standard Kvazaar parameters via ``-kvazaar-params``.

You may need to download "Full" builds. As most of the time, this encoder is not included.

## Supported Color Space

Kvazaar supports the following color spaces:

| Format           | Chroma Subsampling | Supported Bit Depth(s)|
|------------------|:------------------:|-----------------------|
| YUV420P          | 4:2:0              | 8-bit                 |
| YUV420P10LE      | 4:2:0              | 10-bit*               |

*10-bit support requires a flag to be set during compilation with CMake.

## Installation

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="unixlike" label="Linux & macOS" default>
        For Arch Linux, Kvazaar is available as `kvazaar`. It is also available in the Arch User Repository (AUR) as `kvazaar-git`.

        Ultra Video Group does not ship any pre-built binaries of their encoders except for their [AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Ultravideo/kvazaar), but AppVeyor deletes build artifacts after a month, so most of the time you'll have to compile Kvazaar yourself. Here are the instructions to do so:

        ### Autotools

        0. Compilation requires GNU Automake, Autoconf, Libtool, and M4. Install them via your package manager.

        1. Clone the repository and its submodules:
        ```bash
        git clone --recursive https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar.git
        cd kvazaar
        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make -j$(nproc)
        ```

        3. Binaries will be available in `src`, or you can run `make install` on Linux to install (May need elevated permissions).

        ### CMake (10-bit support)

        You will need to use CMake to specify a flag to be able to encode 10-bit with the encoder; by default Kvazaar ships with only 8-bit.

        ```bash
        git clone --recursive https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar.git
        cd kvazaar/build
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-DKVZ_BIT_DEPTH=10" # optional 10-bit flag
        make -j$(nproc)
        ```

        Be aware that encoding 10-bit HEVC with Kvazaar is significantly slower, as the developers only prioritized SIMD optimizations for 8-bit encoding. Be aware that this implementation can be buggy in general.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="wind" label="Windows">
        Windows users are recommended to compile via MinGW-W64 which comes with [MSYS2](https://msys2.org/). Please be advised **the usage of Clang for compiling in this situation is heavily recommended**
        due to disabled AVX2 optimizations because of a known GCC issue from 2012 (MinGW environments-exclusive). To do this, run `CC=clang ./configure` during autoconf.

        ### MSYS2

        0. Make sure you have downloaded & installed MSYS2 from [the MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/) before beginning the build process.

        1. Start the UCRT64 console & install the required dependencies with the `pacman` package manager

        3. Resume the build process as you would on a Unix-like system. See the "Linux & macOS" tab for more information.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use Kvazaar on its own:

```bash title="Simple Y4M input with QP 20 and raw 265 bitstream output"
kvazaar -i input.y4m --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 -o output.265
```

```bash title="Preset slow, CRF 20, Y4M input"
kvazaar -i input.y4m --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 --preset slow -o output.265
```

The command below still uses the `kvazaar` binary, but reads from a YUV4MPEG pipe instead of a file. This is useful for piping FFmpeg output to Kvazaar.

```bash title="FFmpeg piping"
ffmpeg -v error -i input.mkv -f yuv4mpegpipe -strict -1 - | kvazaar -i - --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 --preset slow -o output.265
```
