# x266

x266 is an upcoming software encoder for the [H.266 / VVC](/docs/video/VVC) codec. Very little is currently known about the encoder other than the fact it is still being developed by [MulticoreWare](https://multicorewareinc.com)
and it's dedicated FAQ page after the [31st January 2023 Webinar FAQ](https://multicorewareinc.com/faq-webinar/x266-faq.html).

According to their FAQ, H2 2023 is their "very rough and approximate" ETA for a v1.0 public release, but so far there have been no updates as of 29th March, 2024.
