SVT-VP9 is a [VP9](../video/VP9.mdx) encoder developed by Intel.<br/>
Like [its](../encoders/SVT-HEVC.mdx) [siblings](../encoders/SVT-AV1.mdx) in the SVT encoder family, it scales very well on multicore processors by default.

The [reference encoder](../encoders/vpxenc.mdx) beats it in rate control flexibility and supports 10-bit color,<br/>but SVT-VP9 is much faster out of the box.

## FFmpeg
There are patches bundled in the SVT-VP9 source code for an FFmpeg plugin that adds the `libsvt_vp9` encoder.<br/>
One must recompile FFmpeg with the plugin patch applied to take advantage of it.<br/>
(An easy way to do so on Windows is using [media-autobuild_suite](https://github.com/m-ab-s/media-autobuild_suite).)

Operation is not too different from the SVT-AV1 FFmpeg integration. Your commands will generally look like this:<br/>
`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libsvt_vp9 -qp 38 -tune ssim -preset 7 -g 255 video_vp9.webm`


<details>
<summary>Parameters</summary>

| Parameter           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| -qp              | Quantizer value, higher = lower quality. Range is 1..51 in current patches, but -qmin/-qmax can be set as high as 69 for extreme low bitrates. |
| -preset          | Speed preset. Range is 0..9, with 9 being fastest and default. |
| -tune            | Quality metric. Can be "vq" (default), "ssim" or "vmaf". |
| -g               | Size of the Group of Pictures. Range is -2..255, with -1 = no intraframe updates ever, -2 = "auto".<br/>We recommend you set it as high as possible for encode efficiency. |
| -rc              | Rate control mode.<br/>Can be "cqp" (Constant Quantizer, default), "vbr" (Variable Bitrate) or "cbr" (Constant Bitrate).<br/>(Consider using **vpxenc's two-pass mode** if you really need to match a target bitrate.) |
| -level           | Encoder level. Range is 1..6. Generally better not to set it. |
| -socket          | Index of the CPU socket to use. By default it's -1, which uses "all available processors". |
