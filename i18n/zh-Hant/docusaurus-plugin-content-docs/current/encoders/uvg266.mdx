# uvg266

[uvg266](https://github.com/ultravideo/uvg266/) is an open-source software encoder for encoding to the [H.266 / VVC](/docs/video/VVC) codec. Developed by the [Ultra Video Group](https://ultravideo.fi/), written in C and licensed under BSD 3-clause.
The encoder is based on [Kvazaar](/docs/encoders/Kvazaar), their open source [HEVC](/docs/video/HEVC) encoder solution.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

uvg266 is available in the Arch User Repository (AUR) as `uvg266` and `uvg266-git`.

### Compiling
Ultra Video Group does not ship any pre-built binaries of their encoders so you'll have to compile them yourself. 

Windows users are recommended to compile via MinGW-W64 which comes with [MSYS2](https://msys2.org/).

:::caution
Compilation requires GNU Make and CMake 
:::

:::tip
The following build procedure should work across all common operating systems. Using Clang instead of GCC works.

You may add `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-flto -O3 -march=native" -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-flto -O3 -march=native -pipe -fno-plt" -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT="-flto=8 -static"` in CMake for better performance.
:::

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultravideo/uvg266.git
cd uvg266/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=0
make -j 8
```

Binaries will be available in the same folder (`build`), or you can run `make install` on Linux to install (May need elevated permissions).

### 10-bit Support

You need to compile with `-DUVG_BIT_DEPTH=10` in the CMake `-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS` option to enable support for encoding 10-bit videos.

For example:
```bash
-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-DUVG_BIT_DEPTH=10"
```
With native optimizations:
```bash
-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-flto -O3 -march=native -pipe -fno-plt -DUVG_BIT_DEPTH=10"
```

:::warning
Encoding 10-bit with uvg266 is significantly slower as the developers only prioritized SIMD optimizations for 8-bit, and can get really buggy.

## Usage

```bash title="Simple Y4M input with QP 20 and raw 266 bitstream output"
uvg266 -i input.y4m --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 -o output.266
```

```bash title="Preset slow, CRF 20, Y4M input"
uvg266 -i input.y4m --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 --preset slow -o output.266
```

```bash title="FFmpeg piping"
ffmpeg -v error -i input.mkv -f yuv4mpegpipe -strict -1 - | uvg266 -i - --input-file-format y4m --qp 20 --preset slow -o output.266
```

## Troubleshooting

1. `Could not find a strategy for crc32c_8x8!` - You're out of luck, uvg266 failed to initialize its block partitioning strategy for your specific CPU instruction set, so you **can't use the encoder or encode that specific video**.
