# SVT-HEVC

[SVT-HEVC](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/SVT-HEVC) (Scalable Video Technology for HEVC) is an open source [H.265 / HEVC](/docs/video/HEVC) software encoder developed by Intel made specifically to **only support x86**. As the name suggests, it is part of the "[Scalable Video Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/scalable-video-technology.html)" project lineup by Intel.

The encoder is written in C with some parts in Assembly and licensed under **BSD+Patent**.

:::info
It is recommended to use [x265](/docs/encoders/x265) instead as it performs much better in quality.
:::

## FFmpeg

SVT-HEVC is only available in FFmpeg when it is compiled with their provided [plugin](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/SVT-HEVC/tree/master/ffmpeg_plugin). Otherwise it is via `libsvt_hevc`, to check if you have it, run `ffmpeg -h encoder=libsvt_hevc`.


## Supported Color Space

SVT-HEVC supports the following color spaces:

| Format           | Chroma Subsampling | Supported Bit Depth(s) |
|------------------|:------------------:|-----------------------|
| YUV420P          | 4:2:0              | 8-bit                 |
| YUV420P10LE      | 4:2:0              | 10-bit                |


## Installation

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="unixlike" label="Linux & macOS">
        To build SVT-AV1 from source, first clone the SVT-HEVC repository & enter the build directory.

        ```bash title="Clone SVT-HEVC and cd"
        git clone https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/SVT-HEVC
        cd SVT-HEVC/Build/linux
        ```

        In the directory, simply run `./build.sh [flags]` to build. Be aware that building requires CMake version 3.5.1 or higher and either GCC or Clang. It is recommended to use Clang when building SVT-HEVC.

        ```bash title="Build release"
        ./build.sh release
        ```

        ```bash title="Statically build release"
        ./build.sh static release
        ```

        The compiled binaries will be in the `Bin/Release` directory.

## Usage

### Normal usage
```bash title="Simple Y4M input with QP 20, and raw 265 bitstream output"
SvtHevcEncApp -i input.y4m -q 20 -b output.265
```

```bash title="Preset 4, CRF 20, Y4M input"
SvtHevcEncApp -i input.y4m -q 20 -encMode 4 -b output.265
```

```bash title="FFmpeg piping"
ffmpeg -v error -i input.mkv -f yuv4mpegpipe -strict -1 - | SvtHevcEncApp -i stdin -q 20 -encMode 4 -b output.265
```

:::danger
SVT-HEVC currently does not have the ability to detect EOF (End of File) within Y4M pipes ([issue](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/SVT-HEVC/issues/634#issuecomment-1434911798)), so the encode process will go on indefinitely until your drive is full.
The only known solution is to manually set the number of frames to encode via `-n`.
:::

### Encoding HDR

```bash
SvtHevcEncApp -i input.y4m -q 20 -encMode 4 -hdr -max-cll XXX -max-fall XXX -master-display G(0.265,0.690)B(0.150,0.060)R(0.680,0.320)WP(0.3127,0.3290)L(1000,0.0100) -b output.265
```
Remember sure to adjust the HDR metadata accordingly.

### Encoding with Dolby Vision

The ability to encode with Dolby Vision via RPU file is surprisingly present within SVT-HEVC, although it is limited to Profile 8.1.
```bash
SvtHevcEncApp -i input.y4m -q 20 -encMode 4 -hdr -dolby-vision-rpu RPUFile.bin -dolby-vision-profile 81 -max-cll XXX -max-fall XXX -master-display G(0.265,0.690)B(0.150,0.060)R(0.680,0.320)WP(0.3127,0.3290)L(1000,0.0100) -b output.265
```
Remember sure to adjust the HDR metadata accordingly.


## List of all configuration parameters

As with every SVT line-up, they redirect you to read their "User Guide" instead of presenting what each and every parameter do in the `--help` page.
The table below is an exact copy from their user guide taken from [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenVisualCloud/SVT-HEVC/blob/master/Docs/svt-hevc_encoder_user_guide.md) for backup purposes. Feel free to read them. 


| **Encoder Parameter as shown in the configuration file** | **Command Line parameter** | **Range** | **Default** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Channel Number** | -nch | [1 - 6] | 1 | Number of encode instances |
| **ConfigFile** | -c | any string | null | Configuration file path |
| **InputFile** | -i | any string | null | Input file path and name |
| **StreamFile** | -b | any string | null | Output bitstream file path and name |
| **ErrorFile** | -errlog | any string | stderr | Error log displaying configuration or encode errors |
| **ReconFile** | -o | any string | null | Output reconstructed yuv used for debug purposes. **Note:** using this feature will affect the speed of the encoder significantly. This should only be used for debugging purposes. |
| **UseQpFile** | -use-q-file | [0, 1] | 0 | When set to 1, overwrite the picture qp assignment using qp values in QpFile |
| **QpFile** | -qp-file | any string | null | Path to qp file |
| **SegmentOvFile** | -segment-ov-file | any string | null | Path to segment override file which will allow for sharpness improvement and bit rate reduction on a per segment basis. Refer to config/SVTSegmentOvFile.txt for details. |
| **EncoderMode** | -encMode | [0 - 11] | 7 | A preset defining the quality vs density tradeoff point that the encoding is to be performed at. (e.g. 0 is the highest quality mode, 11 is the highest density mode). Section 3.4 outlines the preset availability per resolution |
| **EncoderBitDepth** | -bit-depth | [8, 10] | 8 | Specifies the bit depth of input video |
| **EncoderColorFormat** | -color-format | [1, 2, 3] | 1 | Specifies the chroma subsampling of input video(1: 420, 2: 422, 3: 444) |
| **CompressedTenBitFormat** | -compressed-ten-bit-format | [0, 1] | 0 | Offline packing of the 2bits: requires two bits packed input (0: OFF, 1: ON) |
| **SourceWidth** | -w | [64 - 8192] | 0 | Input source width |
| **SourceHeight** | -h | [64 - 4320] | 0 | Input source height |
| **FrameToBeEncoded** | -n | [0 - 2^31 -1] | 0 | Number of frames to be encoded, if number of frames is > number of frames in file, the encoder will loop to the beginning and continue the encode. 0 encodes the full clip. |
| **BufferedInput** | -nb | [-1, 1 to 2^31 -1] | -1 | number of frames to preload to the RAM before the start of the encode. If -nb = 100 and –n 1000 --> the encoder will encode the first 100 frames of the video 10 times. Use -1 to not preload any frames.  This parameter is best used to eliminate the impact of disk reading on encoding speed and is most noticeable when frames sizes are 4k or 8k.  Because frames are repeated when value specified (-nb) is less than the total frame count (-n), you should expect bitstreams to be different. |

If FrameRateNumerator and FrameRateDenominator are both !=0 the encoder will ignore this parameter |
| **FrameRateNumerator** | -fps-num | [0 - 2^64 -1] | 0 | Frame rate numerator e.g. 6000 When zero, the encoder will use –fps if FrameRateDenominator is also zero, otherwise an error is returned |
| **FrameRateDenominator** | -fps-denom | [0 - 2^64 -1] | 0 | Frame rate denominator e.g. 100 When zero, the encoder will use –fps if FrameRateNumerator is also zero, otherwise an error is returned |

| **InjectorFrameRate** | -inj-frm-rt | [1 - 240] | 60 | Frame Rate used for the injector. Recommended to match the encoder speed. |
| **SpeedControlFlag** | -speed-ctrl | [0,1] | 0 | Enables the Speed Control functionality to achieve the real-time encoding speed defined by –fps. When this parameter is set to 1 it forces –inj to be 1 and -inj-frm-rt to be set to –fps. |
