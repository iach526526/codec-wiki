JM is the original [H.264](../video/AVC.mdx) reference encoder, predating alternatives like [x264](../encoders/x264.mdx). Since x264 became highly performant and perceptually driven, it joins other MPEG reference encoders such as [HM](../encoders/HM.mdx) & [VTM](../encoders/VTM.mdx) in their reputations for being highly niche offerings that are used rarely due to their usage complexity & speed disadvantages. x264 is generally more efficient than JM.
