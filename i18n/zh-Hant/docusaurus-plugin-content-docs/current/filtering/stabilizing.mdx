## Overview

Stabilizing is a process that reduces unwanted camera movement and shakes in a video clip. This is particularly important, as unpredictable global movement (such as that from a handheld camera) can decrease overall encoding efficiency. The most popular way to stabilize video with [FFmpeg](../utilities/ffmpeg.mdx) is to use the [VidStab](https://github.com/georgmartius/vid.stab) library. To do this, you need a build of FFmpeg compiled with `--enable-libvidstab`.

VidStab actually has two filters within FFmpeg.

```shell
ffmpeg -hide_banner -filters | grep vidstab
 ... vidstabdetect     V->V       Extract relative transformations, pass 1 of 2 for stabilization (see vidstabtransform for pass 2).
 ... vidstabtransform  V->V       Transform the frames, pass 2 of 2 for stabilization (see vidstabdetect for pass 1).
```

The `vidstabdetect` filter is used for the first pass, where the video transformations file (`.trf`) is generated, and `vidstabtransform` is used for the second pass, where transformations are actually applied. This implies that stabilization cannot be achieved in real-time.

## Usage

To stabilize a video using default parameters, you need to run two FFmpeg commands:

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabdetect -f null -
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabtransform output.mp4
```

A file called `transforms.trf` will be created in the directory where you run FFmpeg. After the second step is finished, you can safely remove it. The resulting `output.mp4` video will now have reduced shakiness.

To stabilize a high-framerate video with strong camera movement, set its transformations filename to `a.trf`, and increase the output field of view. You can use the following commands:

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=8:result=a.trf -f null -
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabtransform=smoothing=30:zoom=-5:input=a.trf output.mp4
```

:::tip
Remember to set appropriate video/audio codec parameters in the command before `output.mp4`. You must not use `-c:v copy`, as the video will be transformed.

### vidstabdetect Parameters

- `result`: Sets the output `.trf` file location
- `shakiness`: The amount of movement reduction, where `1` is the least reduction, `10` is the most reduction (highest stabilization), and `5` is the default
- `accuracy`: The accuracy of movement reduction, where `1` is the least accurate, `15` is the most accurate, and `15` is also the default. This setting influences CPU usage during detection. FFmpeg does not allow setting a value lower than `3`. `3` gave a processing speed of `21 fps`, and `15` gave `14 fps`. The process itself is rather CPU-intensive.

For a description of all possible parameters, take a look [here](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#vidstabdetect-1).

### vidstabtransform Parameters

- `input`: Sets the input `.trf` file location created by `vidstabdetect`
- `smoothing`: The number of frames in the future and past used for movement estimation, where the default is `10` (so 10 past and 10 future frames)
- `zoom`: The amount of zoom expressed in percentage, where the default is `0%`. It can be negative, which will create a zoom-out effect.
- `interpol`: The type of interpolation used, where `bilinear` is the default.
  - `no`: No interpolation
  - `linear`: Only horizontal
  - `bilinear`: Faster but can result in blurry output
  - `bicubic`: Slower

## Notes

- The process of stabilization is lossy and can reduce the quality of the video, mainly due to the zoom and interpolation used.
- You might notice overall wobbliness in the resulting video file, especially with higher stabilization levels. This is just how this filter works.
- As you will need to run two passes anyway, you might also consider using two-pass encoding, depending on your use case.
