## 概要

去噪涉及從視頻中去除隨機噪聲。這種噪聲可能來自電影顆粒、信號干擾或簡單的低光條件。無論如何，噪聲都會大大降低壓縮效率，尤其是在不支持電影顆粒合成的舊視頻編碼器中。

在 [FFmpeg](../utilities/ffmpeg.mdx) 中，有兩個專為去噪而設的濾鏡：
- [hqdn3d](#hqdn3d)
- [nlmeans](#nlmeans)

## hqdn3d

hqdn3d 是一個快速、高質量的 3D 去噪濾鏡，可以提高壓縮性。可應用於圖像和視頻。

### Usage

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf hqdn3d output.mp4
```

The default configuration should be fine for most use cases.

If you still see too much noise you can adjust the `luma_spatial` parameter (other parameters are derived from it by default). Higher `luma_spatial` value will result in stronger denoising. By default it is set to `4`.

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf hqdn3d=8 output.mp4
# which is the same as
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf hqdn3d=8:6:12:9 output.mp4
```

:::caution
Setting `luma_spatial` to larger values could result in ghosting and [banding](../filtering/deband.mdx) artifacts.

## nlmeans

nlmeans uses Non-Local Means algorithm to do denoising. Each pixel is compared to similar pixels based on their surroundings - context. The size of such context is expressed as `r`x`r`.

The filter itself is rather slow slow and doesn't parallelize well. It's recommended to only use it in cases the video contains a lot of noise or denoising needs to be very high quality. In all other cases [hqdn3d](#hqdn3d) will be more efficient.

### Usage

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf nlmeans output.mp4
```

The default configuration should be fine for most use cases.

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf nlmeans=s=3.0:r=31:p=15 output.mp4
```

Stronger denoising with larger research and patch size. Might be useful for ultra high quality denoising in 4K+ resolutions but you might struggle to get more than 0.1 fps.

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf nlmeans=s=1.0:r=5:p=3 output.mp4
```

Prioritize speed over quality.

### Parameters

- `s` - Denoising Strength where `1.0` is the lightest and also the default and the strongest is `30.0` although I wouldn't recommend going above `10.0`.
- `r` - Research Size where `15` is the default, it must be an odd number ranging from `0` to `99`. The higher the value, the slower denoising will be.
- `p` - Research Size where `7` is the default and, it must be an odd number ranging from `0` to `99`.

# Notes
- [hqdn3d](#hqdn3d) may create visual artifacts like ghosting, banding and blockiness
- [nlmeans](#nlmeans) creates much less noticable artifacts like cartoonish look but only for very noisy inputs
