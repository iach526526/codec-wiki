ECM (Enhanced Compression Model) is a video codec developed by the Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institute. It is purportedly designed to succeed H.266, or [VVC](../video/VVC.mdx).

The [Git repo](https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/ecm/ECM) provides a bit more information:

```md
# ECM reference software

This software package is the reference software for Enhanced Compression Model (ECM). The reference software includes both encoder and decoder functionality.
Reference software is useful in aiding users of a video coding standard to establish and test conformance and interoperability, and to educate users and demonstrate the capabilities of the test model.
The software has been jointly developed by the ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG, Question 6 of ITU-T Study Group 16) and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG, Working Group 11 of Subcommittee 29 of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1).

Other than this generic overview, build instructions are provided in the repo's README. Not much else is known about ECM besides the fact that it will likely become H.267.
