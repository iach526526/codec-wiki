FFV1 ([rfc9043](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9043)) is a lossless intra-frame video codec designed for archival use & preservation. Created by Michael Niedermayer it is part of the [FFmpeg](../utilities/ffmpeg.mdx) project. The codec supports wide range of color spaces. It can work with YUV and RGB content also including alpha channel with color depths ranging from 8 to 16 bits (only up to 14 in case of RGB). It has good parallelization support and achieves very high compression ratios compared to other lossless video encoders such as [UT Video](../video/utvideo.mdx) albeit at the cost of being more resource hungry.

## History

In 2003 the codec was merged into FFmpeg however the bistream specification was frozen in 2006 (officially FFV1 version 0). Later in 2009 came version 1 covering more bideo bit depths.

Version 2 never got its release, it existed only in experimental form.

The 3rd bistream version was frozen in 2013 and it's still the latest as of 2024. It added multithreading support and frame integrity checking.

There is a 4th version [coming](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-cellar-ffv1-v4/) which might bring better support for color spaces, compression improvements and [maybe](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cellar/gFydpu8BKAgzspvy6Mvbpsrg5yY/) proper inter-frame prediction.

## Usage

```bash title="Fast, heavily multithreaded"
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v ffv1 -slices 16 out.mkv
```

```bash title="Slow, highest compression"
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v ffv1 -g 60 -slices 4 -context 1 -coder 2 out.mkv
```

```bash title="Recommended for archival purposes, high compression, multithreaded"
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v ffv1 -g 1 -slices 16 -slicecrc 1 -context 1 -coder 2 out.mkv
```

### Options
- `slices` - Slices divide frame into multiple parts that can be encoded and decoded in parallel. Can only be one of: [`4`, `6`, `9`, `12`, `16`, `24`, `30`] where `4` is the default.
- `slicecrc` - Setting it to `1` will enable decoder to detect errors in the bitstream. Must be enabled for archival use. Can be eitner `0` or `1`.
- `context` - Setting it to `1` will make encoder use larger context size which usually leads to better compression. Can be eitner `0` or `1`.
- `coder` - Sets entropy coding method:
  - `0` - Golomb-Rice (faster, default)
  - `1` - Range Coder (used for higher bit depths and better compression)
  - `2` - Range Coder with custom state transition table (almost the same as `1`)
- `g` - Sets `GOP size`. Must be `1` for archival use. [see below](#intra-frame-only-catch)

## intra-frame only catch

Intra-frame only codecs do not use common *inter*-frame video coding techniques such as [motion compensation](#TODO), reusing parts of surrounding frames or adapting encoding context based on them. Every frame is independent from one another. Common Intra-frame only codecs may include Motion JPEG (Lossy), Motion JPEG 2000 (Both) or [UT Video](../video/utvideo.mdx) (Lossless).

If you're careful reader you might have noticed that setting `GOP size` isn't a common characteristic amongst intra-frame only codecs.

In fact FFV1 can be considered an intra-frame codec only if `GOP size` is set to `1`. When it's larger than that, its context model depends on other frames found within the `GOP` which contradicts the definition of intra-frame only codec. The main reason why it's strongly recommended to set `GOP size` to `1` for archival purposes is that if one frame gets somehow corrupted, we only lost one frame. If `GOP size` was big we could loose much larger part of the video.
