# Color Formats

To represent color values, a format is agreed upon. Color formats are
made up of three things, the [color model](#color-models)--which includes the
[order of the components](#component-order) and sometimes [chroma subsampling](#chroma-subsampling)--
the [bit depth](#bit-depth), and whether it is a [packed or a planar format](#packed-vs-planar).
In some cases, [endianness](#endianness) may be important.

## Color Models

A color model is a method of representing colors in a video or image using data.
Different color models store color and brightness information in different ways.
There are many different color models, but this section will cover the
models most commonly used for images and video.

### RGB

RGB is probably the most well-known color model, and is primarily used
in image encoding. RGB consists of three color channels, Red, Green,
and Blue, which are then combined to determine the final color of each
pixel. Typically, RGB is the final model that a monitor or TV
will use to display images, because the pixels on a screen are made up
of red, green, and blue LEDs, although it is not commonly used for video
encoding because other models can provide better compression.

### YUV

YUV, also known as YCbCr, is the most widely used color model for
video encoding. It consists of three components: Y aka Luma, which
represents luminance or brightness, and two chroma planes, which
represent color. Generally a video player will have to convert a YUV
video into RGB before it can be rendered, but there are significant
compression benefits to using YUV over RGB for video.

The most notable reason to use YCbCr is an optimization called chroma
subsampling. This means that the chroma components can be encoded at a
lower resolution than the luma components, which results in a smaller
output file. You can read more about chroma subsampling [further below](#chroma-subsampling).

### Component order

The order in which the components in a color model are arranged is simply
represented by writing them out. For example, `RGB` for red first,
then green, then blue, or `BGR` for blue, green, red.

## Bit depth

A bit depth is how many bits are available to store the sample
value. There are two main ways to specify the bit depth in a :

- bits per component. Here, `RGB888` reads as `RGB color model, with 8
bits for the red component, 8 bits for the green component, and 8
bits for the blue component` and `RGB565` reads as `RGB color model,
with 5 bits for the red component, 6 bits for the green component,
and 5 bits for the blue component`.
- bits per sample. Here, `RGB24` reads as `RGB color model, with 24
bits in total for the red, green, and blue components`. This is
  ambiguous, because one does not know exactly how many bits are
  allocated to each component. `RGB565`, `RGB556`, and `RGB655` (even
  though the latter ones do not make much sense as the eye is most
  sensitive to green light) all become `RGB16`.

## Packed vs planar

Components can be stored either packed, where all
components are interleaved (here, `RGB`):

```
Sample number:   1   2   3   4   5
Data:          RGB RGB RGB RGB RGB
```

or stored separately for each component:

```
Sample number: 1 2 3 4 5
Data:          R R R R R...
Data:          G G G G G...
Data:          B B B B B...
```

In planar formats, many operations can be easier to implement, as it
is possible to implement the algorithm once and then operate on all
planes. On the other hand, packed formats are simpler and often used
in hardware.[^vlc-wiki-yuv]

## Endianness

Different computer architectures store numbers differently. For more
information, visit [the Wikipedia article on
endianness](//wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness). There are two main ways
to store numbers with more than 8 bits (1 is the least significant
byte and 4 is the most significant byte, here 4 bytes):

- Most significant byte first, little endian, `4321`. This is what
  x86-family processors use.
- Least significant byte first, big endian, `1234`. This is what
  PowerPC-family processors use.

This can be important for color formats, as some computers might store
it in their native endianness. VapourSynth doesn't seem to care about
endianness, but FFmpeg does.

For example, `RGB565` might store its two bytes in `12` or `21` order,
and if they are read in the wrong order, it will produce garbage.

## Chroma subsampling

In [Y'CbCr](#yuv) signals, there are three widely used
variants of chroma subsampling:

- 4:2:0 which has half the vertical and horizontal chroma resolution
- 4:2:2 which has half the horizontal chroma resolution but full
  vertical resolution
- 4:4:4 which has full chroma resolution (no subsampling)

4:2:2 is not particularly useful over the other options, so this guide
will focus on 4:2:0 and 4:4:4.

4:2:0 is the most commonly used format for videos. Nearly every DVD,
blu-ray, camera recording, etc. uses 4:2:0 subsampling. This is because,
in the majority of cases, human eyes do not notice the reduction in
chroma resolution. There is very little benefit to using 4:4:4 in the
average case.

However, there are some exceptions. The most notable is screen
recordings. Things like text overlays, video game UI overlays,
etc. have very fine, color-dependent detail that can be destroyed by
chroma subsampling and result in an aliased look to the
video. Therefore, it is recommended to use 4:4:4 subsampling when
recording your screen, and 4:2:0 subsampling in most other cases.
