SubStation Alpha (SSA), also known as Advanced Substation Alpha (ASS) for v4+, is a subtitle format. It was originally used by the Windows program of the same name, aimed at the karaoke and anime communities. It's advanced styling compared to alternatives made it popular with release groups.

# Overview
SSA is a "plain" text format, with Unicode support in ASS. It can either be left as a plain text file with the extension of .ssa or .ass, or muxed into a Matroska (.mkv) or AVI (.avi) file. The original SubStation Alpha software is abandonware, however a wide variety of media authoring, muxing, and playing software supports SSA, including [VLC](../video-players.mdx), [MPV](../video-players.mdx), and [FFmpeg](../utilities/ffmpeg.mdx).

## Format
SSA uses the word "script" to refer to the subtitles that track a video. The character ';' at the beginning of a line is used to mark comments.
