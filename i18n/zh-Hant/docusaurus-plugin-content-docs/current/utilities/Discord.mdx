This entry is a bit different from others, and may be moved to a blog post in the future. Below are a number of tables that enumerate the codecs Discord supports for local playback (*not* livestreaming). These tables are based on community testing across a number of platforms, and are not exhaustive.

## Key

The key has a number of emojis corresponding to full support, partial support, support with the [Discord embed workaround](https://wiki.x266.mov/blog/embedding-the-un-embeddable), and no support.

- ✅ Full support
- ⚠️ Partial support
- 🛠️ Support with the Discord embed workaround
- ❔ Untested or unknown
- ❌ No support

If the browser isn't compatible with a particular platform, it will be marked as N/A.
