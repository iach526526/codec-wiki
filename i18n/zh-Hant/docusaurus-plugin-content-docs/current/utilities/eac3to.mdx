# eac3to

eac3to is a command line tool written by madshi to mostly work with audios (conversion) and raw, unencrypted Blu-rays (BDMV).

:::info Compatibility
This is a Windows only software, although usage with Wine is possible.
:::

:::caution Avoid using when possible
There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to use this software unless required by paleolithic [private trackers](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Private_trackers), due to a bajillion dependencies needed that aren't bundled with the download itself. Use something like FFmpeg instead.
