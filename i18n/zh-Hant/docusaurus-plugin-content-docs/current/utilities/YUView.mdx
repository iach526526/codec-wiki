[YUView](https://github.com/IENT/YUView) is a free and open source, cross-platform software developed by [IENT](https://github.com/IENT/) (Institut fÃ¼r Nachrichtentechnik) for working, playing, and analyzing YUV files. 
Though it supports more than YUV thanks to FFmpeg and other third party decoders while providing a lot of options for [HEVC](/docs/video/HEVC) internal visualizations such as slice index and transform depth.

The software is built with QT and written in C++.


## Installation

IENT provides the complete set of binaries for all major desktop operating systems on their GitHub [releases](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/releases/). So pick and choose your OS there.

For Linux, YUView is in the official repo on Ubuntu and the AUR (Arch User Repository) for Arch Linux. But they do provide an AppImage in their releases and a [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/de.rwth_aachen.ient.YUView).

For those who want to compile from source instead, they provided a tutorial [here](https://github.com/IENT/YUView/wiki/Compile-YUView).


## Usage

Open a file via the "File" > "Open File" tab on the top left or by pressing Ctrl + O, you may import multiple files. After that, you can start analyzing the file such as viewing motion vectors, isolating chroma to Cb for YCbCr, etc.
