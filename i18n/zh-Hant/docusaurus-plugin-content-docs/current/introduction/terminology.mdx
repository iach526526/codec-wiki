# 術語
在學習編碼技術時，理解這些用來描述概念的專業術語非常重要，儘管這些概念本身通常並不難理解。

## Bitstream
*Bitstream* 或稱 *bit stream* 是一種媒體檔案，可以在媒體播放器中播放。它包含一個[容器](#container)，包裹了多個[基本流](#elementary-stream)。

## Lossy / Lossless
*Lossy* 編碼會捨棄部分細節以縮小檔案大小。這種取捨通常是可以接受的，但如果你需要完美還原資料，那麼就需要選擇 *lossless* 編碼。

## Elementary stream
基本流是一個音訊、視訊或字幕軌道。它是你希望封裝到容器中的壓縮資料。

## Muxing
將基本流封裝到容器中，這個過程不會改變資料本身。

## Codec
編解碼器（**co**der/**dec**oder）是實際負責編碼你輸入資料的程式碼。它接收資料並生成基本流作為輸出。更多資訊可參考[序章](./prologue.mdx#what-is-a-codec)中的「什麼是編解碼器」部分。

## Filter
Filter 是一段程式碼，用來對資料進行處理，使其具備不同的效果，例如銳化、去除雜訊、穩定畫面、去噪、縮放或疊加等。

## Muxer/Demuxer
這些程式碼用來進行[封裝](#muxing)操作，或反向操作以從容器中提取 elementary stream。


## Bitstream filter
A bitstream filter is a filter that is directly applied to the [bitstream](#bitstream) in order to change something about the container, for instance, convert frame types, or corrupt some packets.

## Container
A container is a format for putting one or more elementary streams into one file, which is then called a [bitstream](#bitstream).

A video container is a digital file format that holds video and audio data, as well as additional information such as subtitles, metadata, and chapter markers. It acts as a "wrapper" that packages all these elements into a single file that can be played on various devices and software platforms. Think of it like a container you might use to transport goods - the video and audio data are like the items being transported, while the container itself provides a structure and organization for the contents.

Some kinds of containers:

#### MP4 / M4V

This is likely the most common container you've encountered, & has near universal compatibility. Has a limited maximum amount of streams. The supported video codecs are [H.264](../video/AVC.mdx), [H.265](../video/HEVC.mdx), [H.266](../video/VVC.mdx), DivX, Xvid, [VP9](../video/VP9.mdx) (Unofficial, hacky), and [AV1](../video/AV1.mdx) (Unofficial, hacky). For audio codecs it's many of the various flavors of [AAC](../audio/AAC.mdx), [MP3](../audio/MP3.mdx), [FLAC](../audio/FLAC.mdx) (Unofficial), [Opus](../audio/Opus.mdx) (Unofficial, hacky). For subtitles only MPEG-4 Timed Text (TTXT) is supported.

The best tool to work with this container is MP4Box, but FFmpeg also works.

#### MOV

Similar to MP4, but less supported. Made with Apple Quicktime in mind, supports ProRes.

#### MKV / MKA / MKS / MK3D

Also known as Matroska, allows an unlimited amount of video/audio/subtitle streams and any codec that probably still exists in Area 51, you can put literally anything in there and it won't even care, MPEG-2/DivX/H.266/Theora/Thor/RealVideo/MJPEG/AVS3/AMR-WB, you name it. All around best container for working with if you have the choice.

#### WebM

A container made with web streaming in mind. WebM is a stripped-down subset of MKV that only allows free & open source codecs such as VP8, VP9 or AV1 for video alongside Vorbis or Opus for audio. It is a common misconception that [WebVTT](../subtitles/webvtt.mdx) tracks always work natively in browsers when within a WebM container; in practice, WebMs containing WebVTT subtitles *will usually not* play back the subtitles in browsers. WebVTT subtitles can be utilized with the `<track>` element instead, meaning they exist outside the WebM container itself. More info in the [Mozilla Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Audio_and_video_delivery/Adding_captions_and_subtitles_to_HTML5_video).

## Transcoding
Taking an elementary stream & converting it to another format, lossless or lossy, using an encoder of some kind. For example, if I convert a lossless [FFV1](../video/FFV1.mdx) video to a lossy AV1 video using an encoder like [rav1e](../encoders/rav1e.mdx), I have *transcoded* this lossless video to AV1. Transcoding doesn't have anything to do with the container.

## RDO
RDO, or Rate-Distortion Optimization, is a technique used to find the best trade-off between the bit rate & the quality of lossily encoded content. RDO can be metric-based, optimizing to score well on metrics like [PSNR](../metrics/PSNR.mdx) or [SSIM](../metrics/SSIM.mdx).

## Perceputal / Psychovisual / Psychoacoustic
"Psychovisual quality" (for videos), "Psychoacoustic quality" (for audio), or "perceptual quality" is a term used to describe the perception of quality of distorted media by the human senses. The goal of any multimedia codec is to minimize data while maintaining perceived quality, and optimizing around human perception theoretically yields the best performance within any limited set of coding techniques (like when using an older codec). Our model of human perception continues to evolve, which makes modelling perceptual quality very difficult. Presently, the metrics [SSIMULACRA2](../metrics/SSIMULACRA2.mdx) (Images/Video) & [Butteraugli](../metrics/butteraugli.mdx) (Video) are considered the most accurate to our human visual system.

## Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
The Discrete Cosine Transform is a mathematical transformation that can transform discrete data into the frequency domain. This discrete data could be pixels in an image/video compression block or data points recorded temporally representing an audio recording. This algorithm is a particularly good choice for image, video, music, & speech compression because it has high energy compaction relative to our understanding of fidelity in media. High energy compaction means the DCT is able to represent a signal with a small number of significant coefficients.
