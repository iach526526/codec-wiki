Lossy multimedia compression reduces the file size of multimedia data by permanently removing some of the information. This process leverages the limitations of the human senses, fidelity metrics, or appeal metrics to discard information that is considered less salient. The goal of lossy compression is to reduce the file size of multimedia data while maintaining a desired level of quality.

## How Lossy Compression Works

Lossy compression works by analyzing the input signal and removing parts of it that are less salient. Some processes by which this is done include:

- **Perceptual Coding** (audio): This technique removes audio frequencies that are outside the range of human hearing or masked by other sounds.
- **Quantization** (audio): This process reduces the precision of certain audio components, which can significantly reduce file size without a noticeable impact on perceived quality.
