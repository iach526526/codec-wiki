Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is an image file format first released by CompuServe in 1987. It remains popular due to it's widespread support for animated images despite its obsolete efficency. Other animated image formats like Animated [AVIF](../images/AVIF.mdx) & Animated [WebP](../images/WebP.mdx) have since surpassed GIF in functionality, as has the animated [PNG](../images/PNG.mdx) variant APNG.
